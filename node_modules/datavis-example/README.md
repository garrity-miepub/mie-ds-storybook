# Example DataVis User

This package exemplifies how to use DataVis.

1. Install dependencies: `npm install`
2. Compile JS: `npm run rollup`
3. Try it out: `npm run serve`, visit [page/test.html](http://localhost:5000/page/test.html).

## Non-DataVis Dependencies

DataVis does not bundle JavaScript for jQuery or jQuery plugins.  It also doesn't bundle CSS, images, or fonts.  So you need to bring these things in on your own somehow.

| Project            | Content     | DataVis Dep |
| ------------------ | ----------- | ----------- |
| jQuery             | JS          | Yes         |
| jQuery UI          | JS + CSS    | Yes         |
| BlockUI            | JS          | No          |
| jQuery ContextMenu | JS + CSS    | Yes         |
| SumoSelect         | JS + CSS    | Yes         |
| Flatpickr          | JS + CSS    | Yes         |
| Font Awesome       | CSS + Fonts | No          |

DataVis dependencies can be grabbed from your `node_modules` directory... the others you need to find yourself.  The reason for all this is that we haven't yet moved everything that is currently managed by Webchart into DataVis itself.
